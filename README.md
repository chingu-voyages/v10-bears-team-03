<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many fitness tracking applications out there for enthusiasts. However, just as important as your 'Just DO It' attitude is the equipment you use and the state of its wear. This application will not only track where you have been and where you are going, it will also track the wear and tear of your equipment.

Outline of Features:
* Inventory tracking including date purchases, mileage of equipment, prices etc...
* A colorcoded status of your equipment providing information as to when to check up on your equipment and check for possible replacement or repair.
* And, of course, track your accomplishments like most other fitness trackers.

We may decide to add the following features as well:
(ideas?)
